Example code to work with `AlphaSimR` to  
1. Create founder haplotypes with and without population structure  
2. Get breeding values from `AlphaSimR` and from an "experiment"  
3. Play with directional dominance and evaluate inbreeding depression  
4. Run that through some selection cycles and see how breeding depression evloves
